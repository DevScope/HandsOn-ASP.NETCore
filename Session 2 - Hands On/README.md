# Introduction to ASP.NET Core 2.0 #

---

<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

ASP.NET Core 2.0 is a new open-source and cross-platform framework for building modern cloud-based Web applications using .NET. It was built from the ground up to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are either deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. It consists of modular components with minimal overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your solutions. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core applications cross-platform on Windows, Mac and Linux. ASP.NET Core is fully open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/aspnet/home).

ASP.NET Core is built with the needs of modern Web applications in mind, including a unified story for building Web UI and Web APIs that integrate with today’s modern client-side frameworks and development workflows. ASP.NET Core is also built to be cloud-ready by introducing environment-based configuration and by providing built-in dependency injection support.

In this exercise you will create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application project in Visual Studio 2015. You will then explore the generated solution and identify its parts, and finally you will see the Web site in action.

<a name="Ex1Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Creating a New Site Using the One ASP.NET Experience ####

In this task you will start creating a new Web site in Visual Studio based on the **ASP.NET 5 Web Application** project template.

1. Open **Visual Studio Community 2015** and select **File | New Project...** to start a new solution.

	![Creating a New Project](Images/creating-a-new-project.png?raw=true "Creating a New Project")

	_Creating a New Project_

1. In the **New Project** dialog box, select **ASP.NET Web Application** under the **Visual C# | Web** tab, and make sure **.NET Framework 4.6** is selected. Name the project _MyWebApplication_, choose a **Location** and click **OK**.

	![New ASP.NET Web Application project](Images/creating-new-aspnet-web-application-project.png?raw=true "New ASP.NET Web Application project")

	_Creating a new ASP.NET Web Application project_

1. In the **New ASP.NET Project** dialog box, select the **Web Application** template under **ASP.NET 5 Templates**. Also, make sure that the **Authentication** option is set to **Individual User Accounts**. Click **OK** to continue.

	![Creating a new project with the ASP.NET 5 Web Application template](Images/creating-a-new-aspnet5-project.png?raw=true "Creating a new project with the ASP.NET 5 Web Application template")

	_Creating a new project with the ASP.NET 5 Web Application template_

1. You can now explore the structure of the generated solution.

	![Exploring the generated solution](Images/exploring-the-generated-solution.png?raw=true "Exploring the generated solution")

	_Exploring the generated solution_

	1. **global.json:** This file is used to configure the solution as a whole. It includes just two sections, projects and sdk by default.
	1. **References**: This folder details the server-side references for the project which might be assemblies, NuGet packages, or projects.
	1. **wwwroot:** This special folder represents the actual root of the web app when running on a web server. Resources like images, script files and stylesheets are located inside this folder.
	1. **Dependencies:** This section contains two subfolders: **Bower** and **NPM**. These folders correspond to two package managers by the same names, and they’re used to pull in client-side dependencies and tool.
	1. **Migrations:** This folder contains the Entity Frameworks migrations. This folder is added when the **Individual User Accounts** authentication option is selected during the configuration of the project template.
	1. **Models:** This folder will contain the classes that represent your application data.
	1. **Controllers**, **ViewModels**, **Views** and **Services**: These folders are related with **ASP.NET MVC** components. Except for the Controllers folder, these folders are added when the **Individual User Accounts** authentication option is selected during the configuration of the project template. You will explore the MVC and Web API technologies in the next exercises.
	1. **appsettings.json:** This file contains the configurations like connection strings and logging levels.
	1. **gulpfile.js:** This file contains the Gulp tasks for the project.
	1. **project.json:** This file is used to define the project’s server side dependencies, as well as other project-specific information.
	1. **Startup.cs:** class file wires up configuration, MVC, EF, Identity services, logging, routes, and more. It provides a good example for how to configure the services used by your ASP.NET app.

1. Double-click the **Index.cshtml** file located inside the _Views/Home_ folder, to explore the content of the page.

	![Exploring the Index.cshtml page](Images/index-page.png?raw=true "Exploring the Index.cshtml page")

	_Exploring the Index.cshtml page_

1. Double-click the **_Layout.cshtml** file located inside the _Views/Shared_ folder, to explore the layout of the page.

	![Exploring the _Layout.cshtml page](Images/layout-page.png?raw=true "Exploring the _Layout.cshtml page")

	_Exploring the _Layout.cshtml page_

1. Open the **Startup.cs** file. In the _Startup_ class you will find the wires up configuration. At the end of the **Configure** method, you will find the configuration which maps HTTP routes to **controllers**.

	<!-- mark:5-10 -->
	````C#
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
    {
        // ...

        app.UseMvc(routes =>
        {
            routes.MapRoute(
                name: "default",
                template: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
        });
    }
	````

<a name="Ex1Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 - Running the Solution ####

In this task you will run the generated solution, explore the app and some of its features, like URL rewriting and built-in authentication.

1. To run the solution, press **F5** or click the **Start** button located on the toolbar. The application home page should open in the browser.

	![Running the solution](Images/running-the-solution.png?raw=true "Running the solution")

	_Running the solution_

1. Verify the configured routes. To do this, append **/Home/Contact** to the URL in the address bar and press **Enter**.

	![Navigating to the Contact action](Images/navigating-to-contacts.png?raw=true "Navigating to the Contact action")

	_Navigating to the Contact action_

1. You will now explore the authentication flow integrated into the application. To do this, click **Register** in the upper-right corner of the page.

	![Registering a new user](Images/registering-a-new-account.png?raw=true "Registering a new user")

	_Registering a new user_

1. In the **Register** page, enter an **Email** and **Password**, and then click **Register**.

	![Register page](Images/register-page.png?raw=true)

	_Register page_

1. You will be prompt with the following error page that indicates that applying the migrations may resolve the issue. Click **Apply Migrations** and refresh the page once this action is completed.

	![Applying the migrations](Images/applying-the-migrations.png?raw=true "Applying the migrations")

	_Applying the migrations_

1. The application registers the new account, and the user is authenticated.

	![User authenticated](Images/user-authenticated.png?raw=true)

	_User authenticated_

1. Go back to Visual Studio and press **SHIFT + F5** to stop debugging.

<a name="Exercise2"></a>
### Exercise 2: Creating an MVC Controller Using Scaffolding ###
In this exercise you will take advantage of the ASP.NET Scaffolding framework provided by Visual Studio to create an ASP.NET MVC 6 controller with actions and Razor views to perform CRUD operations, without writing a single line of code. The scaffolding process will use Entity Framework Code First to generate the data context and the database schema in the SQL database.

**About Entity Framework Code First**

Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper (ORM) that enables you to create data access applications by programming with a conceptual application model instead of programming directly using a relational storage schema.

The Entity Framework Code First modeling workflow allows you to use your own domain classes to represent the model that EF relies on when performing querying, change-tracking and updating functions. Using the Code First development workflow, you do not need to begin your application by creating a database or specifying a schema. Instead, you can write standard .NET classes that define the most appropriate domain model objects for your application, and Entity Framework will create the database for you.

> **Note:** You can learn more about Entity Framework [here](http://www.asp.net/entity-framework).

<a name="Ex2Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Creating a New Model ####

You will now define a **Person** class, which will be the model used by the scaffolding process to create the MVC controller and the views. You will start by creating a **Person** model class, and the CRUD operations in the controller will be automatically created using scaffolding features.

1. Open **Visual Studio Community 2015** and the **MyWebApplication.sln** solution located in the **Source/Ex2-MvcScaffolding/Begin** folder. Alternatively, you can continue with the solution that you obtained in the previous exercise.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Models** folder of the **MyWebApplication** project and select **Add | Class...**.

	![Adding the Person model class](Images/adding-the-person-model-class.png?raw=true "Adding the Person model class")

	_Adding the Person model class_

1. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, name the file _Person.cs_ and click **Add**.

	![Creating the Person model class](Images/creating-the-person-model-class.png?raw=true "Creating the Person model class")

	_Creating the Person model class_

1. Replace the content of the **Person.cs** file with the following code. Press **CTRL + S** to save the changes.

	(Code Snippet - _IntroASPNET5 - Ex2 - PersonClass_)
	<!-- mark:1-11 -->
	````C#
    namespace MyWebApplication.Models
    {
        public class Person
        {
            public int Id { get; set; }

            public string Name { get; set; }

            public int Age { get; set; }
        }
    }
	````

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **MyWebApplication** project and select **Build**, or press **CTRL + SHIFT + B** to build the project.

<a name="Ex2Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 - Creating an MVC Controller ####

Now that the **Person** model is created, you will use ASP.NET MVC scaffolding with Entity Framework to create the CRUD controller actions and views for **Person**.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Controllers** folder of the **MyWebApplication** project and select **Add | New Scaffolded Item...**.

	![Creating a new scaffolded Controller](Images/creating-a-new-scaffolded-controller.png?raw=true "Creating a new Scaffolded Controller")

	_Creating a new Scaffolded Controller_

1. In the **Add Scaffold** dialog box, select **MVC 6 Controller with views, using Entity Framework** and then click **Add.**

	![Selecting MVC 6 Controller with views and Entity Framework](Images/selecting-mvc-6-controller.png?raw=true "Selecting MVC 6 Controller with views and Entity Framework")

	_Selecting MVC 6 Controller with views and Entity Framework_

1. Set _MvcPersonController_ as the **Controller name**, select the **Use async controller actions** option and select **Person (MyHybridSite.Models)** as the **Model class**.

	![Adding an MVC controller with scaffolding](Images/adding-an-mvc-controller-with-scaffolding.png?raw=true "Adding an MVC controller with scaffolding")

	_Adding an MVC controller with scaffolding_

1. Under **Data context class**, click **New data context** button. 

	![Creating a new data context](Images/creating-a-new-data-context.png?raw=true "Creating a new data context")

	_Creating a new data context_

1. In the **New Data Context** dialog box, name the new data context _PersonContext_ and click **Add**.

	![Creating the new PersonContext](Images/creating-the-new-personcontext.png?raw=true "Creating the new PersonContext")

	_Creating the new PersonContext type_

1. Click **Add** to create the new controller for **Person** with scaffolding. Visual Studio will then generate the controller actions, the Person data context and the Razor views.

	![After creating the MVC controller with scaffolding](Images/after-creating-the-mvc-controller-with-scaffo.png?raw=true "After creating the MVC controller with scaffolding")

	_After creating the MVC controller with scaffolding_

1. Open the **MvcPersonController.cs** file in the **Controllers** folder. Notice that the CRUD action methods have been generated automatically. 

	````C#
    // ...

    // POST: MvcPeople/Create
    [HttpPost]
    [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Create(Person person)
    {
        if (ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            _context.Person.Add(person);
            await _context.SaveChangesAsync();
            return RedirectToAction("Index");
        }
        return View(person);
    }

    // GET: MvcPeople/Edit/5
    public async Task<IActionResult> Edit(int? id)
    {
        if (id == null)
        {
            return HttpNotFound();
        }

        Person person = await _context.Person.SingleAsync(m => m.Id == id);
        if (person == null)
        {
            return HttpNotFound();
        }
        return View(person);
    }

    // ...
````

	> **Note:** By selecting the **Use async controller actions** check box from the scaffolding options in the previous steps, Visual Studio generates asynchronous action methods for all actions that involve access to the Person data context. It is recommended that you use asynchronous action methods for long-running, non-CPU bound requests to avoid blocking the Web server from performing work while the request is being processed.

<a name="Ex2Task3"></a>
#### Task 3 - Running the Solution ####

In this task, you will run the solution again to verify that the views for **Person** are working as expected. You will add a new person to verify that it is successfully saved to the database. 

1. Press **F5** to run the solution.

1. Navigate to **/MvcPerson**. The scaffolded view that shows the list of people should appear.

1. Click **Create New** to add a new person.

	![Navigating to the scaffolded MVC views](Images/navigating-to-the-scaffolded-mvc-views.png?raw=true)

	_Navigating to the scaffolded MVC views_

1. In the **Create** view, provide a **Name** and an **Age** for the person, and click **Create**.

	![Adding a new person](Images/adding-a-new-person.png?raw=true)

	_Adding a new person_

1. The new person is added to the list. In the element list, click **Details** to display the person's details view. Then, in the **Details** view, click **Back to List** to go back to the list view.

	![Person's details view](Images/person-details-view.png?raw=true)

	_Person's details view_

1. Click the **Delete** link to delete the person. In the **Delete** view, click **Delete** to confirm the operation.

	![Deleting a person](Images/deleting-a-person.png?raw=true)

	_Deleting a person_

1. Go back to Visual Studio and press **SHIFT + F5** to stop debugging.

### Exercise 3: Creating an API Controller Using Scaffolding ###

HTTP is not just for serving up web pages. It’s also a powerful platform for building APIs that expose services and data. HTTP is simple, flexible, and ubiquitous. Almost any platform that you can think of has an HTTP library, so HTTP services can reach a broad range of clients, including browsers, mobile devices, and traditional desktop apps.

Previous versions of ASP.NET included the Web API framework for creating web APIs. In ASP.NET Core, this functionality has been merged into the MVC 6 framework. Unifying the two frameworks makes it simpler to build apps that include both UI (HTML) and APIs, because now they share the same code base and pipeline.

In this exercise, you will use ASP.NET Scaffolding again to generate a web API controller. You will use the same **Person** and **PersonContext** classes from the previous exercise to provide the same person data in JSON format. You will see how you can expose the same resources in different ways within the same ASP.NET application.

<a name="Ex3Task1"></a>
#### Task 1 - Creating an API Controller ####

In this task you will create a new **API Controller** that will expose the person data in a machine-consumable format like JSON.

1. If not already opened, open **Visual Studio Community 2015** and open the **MyWebApplication.sln** solution located in the **Source/Ex3-WebAPI/Begin** folder. Alternatively, you can continue with the solution that you obtained in the previous exercise.

	>**Note:** If you start with the Begin solution from Exercise 3, press **CTRL + SHIFT + B** to build the solution.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Controllers** folder of the **MyWebApplication** project and select **Add | New Scaffolded Item...**.

	![Creating a new scaffolded Controller](Images/creating-a-new-scaffolded-controller.png?raw=true)

	_Creating a new scaffolded Controller_

1. In the **Add Scaffold** dialog box, select **Web API** in the left pane, then **API Controller with actions, using Entity Framework** in the middle pane and then click **Add.**

	![Selecting API Controller with actions and Entity Framework](Images/selecting-api-controller.png?raw=true "Selecting API Controller with actions and Entity Framework")

	_Selecting API Controller with actions and Entity Framework_

1. Set _ApiPersonController_ as the **Controller name**, select the **Use async controller actions** option and select **Person (MyWebApplication.Models)** and **PersonContext (MyWebApplication.Models)** as the **Model** and **Data context** classes respectively. Then click **Add**.

	![Adding an API Controller with scaffolding](Images/adding-an-api-controller-with-scaffolding.png?raw=true "Adding an API controller with scaffolding")

	_Adding an API controller with scaffolding_

1. Visual Studio will then generate the **ApiPersonController** class with the four CRUD actions to work with your data.

	![After creating the API controller with scaffolding](Images/after-creating-the-api-controller.png?raw=true "After creating the API controller with scaffolding")

	_After creating the API controller with scaffolding_

1. Open the **ApiPersonController.cs** file and inspect the _GetPerson_ action method. This method queries the db field of **PersonContext** type in order to get the people data.

	<!--mark: 5-->
	````C#
    // GET: api/ApiPerson
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Person> GetPerson()
    {
        return _context.Person;
    }
	````

1. Now notice the comment above the method definition. It provides the URI that exposes this action which you will use in the next task.

	<!--mark: 1-->
	````C#
    // GET: api/ApiPerson
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Person> GetPerson()
    {
        return _context.Person;
    }
	````

1. Notice the attributes of the **ApiPersonController** class. This attributes specify the output of the actions which in this case is `application/json`, as well as the base route; which in this case is `api/ApiPerson`

	<!--mark: 3-4-->
	````C#
    namespace MyWebApplication.Controllers
    {
        [Produces("application/json")]
        [Route("api/ApiPerson")]
        public class ApiPersonController : Controller
        { 
            // ...
	````

<a name="Ex3Task2"></a>
#### Task 2 - Running the Solution ####

In this task you will use the Microsoft Edge **F12 developer tools** to inspect the full response from the API controller. You will see how you can capture network traffic to get more insight into your application data.

> **Note:** Make sure that **Microsoft Edge** is selected in the **Start** button located on the Visual Studio toolbar.
>
> ![Microsoft Edge option](Images/microsoft-edge-option.png?raw=true "Microsoft Edge option")
>
> _Microsoft Edge option_
>
>The **F12 developer tools** have a wide set of functionality that is not covered in this hands-on-lab. If you want to learn more about it, refer to [Using the F12 developer tools](https://dev.windows.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/documentation/f12-devtools-guide/).

1. Press **F5** to run the solution.

	>**Note:** In order to follow this task correctly, your application needs to have data. If your database is empty, you can go back to Task 3 in Exercise 2 and follow the steps on how to create a new person using the MVC views. 

1. In the browser, press **F12** to open the **Developer Tools** panel. Press **CTRL** + **4** or click the **Network** icon, and then click the **clean session** button to begin capturing network traffic.

	![Initiating Web API network capture](Images/initiating-web-api-network-capture.png?raw=true "Initiating Web API network capture")

	_Initiating Web API network capture_

1. Append **api/ApiPerson** to the URL in the browser's address bar. You will now inspect the details of the response from the **ApiPersonController**.

	![Retrieving person data through the API](Images/retrieving-person-data-through-web-api.png?raw=true "Retrieving person data through the API")

	_Retrieving person data through the API_

1. Now you will inspect the body of the response. To do this, click the **Details** tab and then click **Response body**. You can check that the downloaded data is a list of objects with the properties **Id**, **Name** and **Age** that correspond to the **Person** class.
